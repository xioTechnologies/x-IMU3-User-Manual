The \ac{LED} indicates the mode and status of the x-IMU3 using different colours and flashing behaviours.

\subsection{Wireless disabled (green)}

A green \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:greenLed} indicates that the x-IMU3 is switched on and that the wireless mode is disabled.  In this mode, the \ac{LED} indicates the data logger state.  Flashing indicates that the data logger is disabled and a solid \ac{LED} indicates that the data logger is enabled.

\subsection{Wi-Fi client (cyan)}

A cyan \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:cyanLed} indicates that the x-IMU3 is switched on and in Wi-Fi client mode. Slow flashing (once per second) indicates that x-IMU3 is not connected to an \ac{AP}, fast flashing (five times per second) indicates that the x-IMU3 is connected to an \ac{AP} but has not yet obtained an \ac{IP} address, and a solid \ac{LED} indicates that the x-IMU3 is connected to an \ac{AP} and has an \ac{IP} address.

\subsection{Wi-Fi AP (magenta)}

A magenta \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:magentaLed} indicates that the x-IMU3 is switched on and in Wi-Fi \ac{AP} mode.  The \ac{LED} will flash during the initialisation of the Wi-Fi network.  Once the network has been created, the \ac{LED} will remain solid.

\subsection{Bluetooth (blue)}

A blue \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:blueLed} indicates that the x-IMU3 is switched on and in Bluetooth mode.  Slow flashing (once per second) indicates that Bluetooth is not connected and the x-IMU3 is not discoverable, fast flashing (five times per second) indicates that Bluetooth is not connected and the x-IMU3 is discoverable, and a solid \ac{LED} indicates that Bluetooth is connected.  The x-IMU3 is not discoverable while Bluetooth is connected.

\subsection{Error (red)}

A red \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:redLed} indicates an error.  The \ac{LED} will interrupt it's normal behaviour to blink red each time an error message is sent by the x-IMU3.

\subsection{Low battery and charging (orange)}

An orange \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:orangeLed} indicates either a low battery the x-IMU3 is switched on, or the charging status if the x-IMU3 is switched off.  The \ac{LED} will interrupt it's normal behaviour to blink orange once a second to indicate that the battery is low.  If the x-IMU3 is switched off and USB power is connected then the \ac{LED} will remain solid while the x-IMU3 is charging and blink once every four seconds once charging is complete.

\subsection{User control}

The \ac{LED} can be controlled by the user using the strobe and colour commands.  See \Fref{sec:strobeCommand} and \Fref{sec:colourCommand} for more information.
