\subsection{Wireless disabled (green)}

\subsection{Wi-Fi client (cyan)}

A cyan \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:cyanLed} indicates that the x-IMU3 is switched on and in Wi-Fi client mode.  Flashing indicates that that the x-IMU3 is not connected to an \ac{AP} or has not yet obtained an \ac{IP} address.  A solid \ac{LED} indicates that x-IMU3 has successfully connected to the network.

\subsection{Wi-Fi AP (magenta)}

A magenta \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:magentaLed} indicates that the x-IMU3 is switched on and in Wi-Fi \ac{AP} mode.  The \ac{LED} will flash during the initialisation of the Wi-Fi network.  Once the network has been created, the \ac{LED} will remain solid.

\subsection{Bluetooth (blue)}

A blue \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:blueLed} indicates that the x-IMU3 is switched on and in Bluetooth mode.

\subsection{Data logger (yellow)}

A yellow \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:yellowLed} indicates the data logger status.  The \ac{LED} will interrupt it's normal behaviour to blink yellow once every two seconds while the data logger is logging.

\subsection{Error (red)}

A red \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:redLed} indicates an error.  The \ac{LED} will interrupt it's normal behaviour to blink red each time an error message is sent by the x-IMU3.

\subsection{Low battery and charging (orange)}

An orange \ac{LED}, as shown in \Fref{fig:orangeLed} indicates either a low battery if the x-IMU3 is switched on, or the charging status if the x-IMU3 is switched off.  The \ac{LED} will interrupt it's normal behaviour to blink orange once every two seconds to indicate that the battery is low.  If the x-IMU3 is switched off and USB power is connected then the \ac{LED} will remain solid while the x-IMU3 is charging and switch off when charging is complete.

\subsection{User control}

The \ac{LED} can be controlled by the user using the strobe and colour commands.  See \Fref{sec:strobeCommand} and \Fref{sec:colourCommand} for a description of each command.
